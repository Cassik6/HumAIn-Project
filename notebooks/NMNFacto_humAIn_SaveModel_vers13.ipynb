      "Back in 2011, the McKinsey Global Institute published a report highlighting the \n",
      "transformational potential of big data.\n",
      "1 Five years later, we remain convinced that this \n",
      "potential has not been overhyped. In fact, we now believe that our 2011 analyses gave only a \n",
      "partial view. The range of applications and opportunities has grown even larger today. \n",
      "The convergence of several technology trends is accelerating progress. The volume of \n",
      "data continues to double every three years as information pours in from digital platforms, \n",
      "\n",
      "wireless sensors, and billions of mobile phones. Data storage capacity has increased, while \n",
      "its cost has plummeted. Data scientists now have unprecedented computing power at their \n",
      "disposal, and they are devising ever more sophisticated algorithms. \n",
      "The companies at the forefront of these trends are using their capabilities to tackle business \n",
      "problems with a whole new mindset. In some cases, they have introduced data-driven \n",
      "business models that have taken entire industries by surprise. Digital natives have an \n",
      "enormous advantage, and to keep up with them, incumbents need to apply data and \n",
      "\n",
      "analytics to the fundamentals of their existing business while simultaneously shifting the \n",
      "\n",
      "basis of competition. In an environment of increasing volatility, legacy organizations need \n",
      "to have one eye on high-risk, high-reward moves of their own, whether that means entering \n",
      "new markets or changing their business models. At the same time, they have to apply \n",
      "\n",
      "analytics to improve their core operations. This may involve identifying new opportunities \n",
      "\n",
      "on the revenue side, using analytics insights to streamline internal processes, and building \n",
      "mechanisms for experimentation to enable continuous learning and feedback. \n",

      "opportunities and thwart potential disruptorsŠand they have to assume that those \n",

      "\n",
      "industries, and change will only accelerate as machine learning and deep learning develop \n",
      "capabilities to think, problem-solve, and understand language. The potential uses of these \n",
      "technologies are remarkably broad, even for sectors that have been slow to digitize. As we \n",

      "To determine where machine learning is most relevant, we began by collecting as many \n",
      "possible use cases as we could across 12 industry groupings. This use-case driven \n",
      "approach ensured that our perspective on machine learning was grounded in actual \n",
      "\n",
      "industry-speci˚c applications and could be categorized or grouped across industries.\n",
      "To collect these use cases, we ˚rst characterized machine learning capabilities or problem \n",
      "types. We used this list of problem types to co-create a list of more than 300 use cases with \n",
      "about 50 industry experts. The use cases were also classi˚ed across nine ﬁuse case typesﬂ \n",
      "\n",
      "as recurring themes emerged in our analysis. This grouping is used in a number of exhibits in \n",
      "\n",
      "this appendix.\n",
      "The 300 use cases formed the basis for our analysis of the potential of machine learning. \n",
      "Across all of these use cases, we constructed two separate indexes to characterize the \n",
      "scope and scale.\n",
      "First, we estimated the value potential by conducting a survey across internal McKinsey \n",
      "experts aligned to the industries included in our report. In this survey, respondents were \n",
      "asked to rank the top three use cases in their industry out of a prioritized list of ten. Then, for \n",
      "each of the 120 use cases we constructed a value index by weighting the number of times \n",
      "\n",
      "each use case was ranked ˚rst by three respondents, second by two, and third by one.\n",
      "105The landscape of impact scoring across use case types and industry groups is presented \n",

      "\n",
      "to have value across industries.\n",
      "Second, we assessed the data richness available for each of the 300 total use cases. The \n",
      "two criteria we focused on were as follows:\n",
      " Volume of data:\n",
      " Higher volumes of data mean more data points for the algorithms to \n",

      "\n",
      "frequency measure: how many individual data points there were as well as how often \n",
      "\n",
      "an interaction happened with each data point over the course of a year. After that, we \n",
      "multiplied the volume and frequency to arrive at an aggregate volume measure.\n",
      " Variety of data:\n",
      " In addition to volume, the variety of data can play a crucial role. The \n",
